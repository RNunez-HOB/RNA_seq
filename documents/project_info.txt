Despite extensive global research efforts, predisposing 
conditions and mechanisms leading to post-COVID remain 
poorly understood. While age and sex have most frequently 
been cited as predispositions, perturbations of the 
peripheral immune system have been associated with its 
pathogenesis. To deepen the current knowledge, we here 
investigated the immunological landscapes of 44 post-COVID 
patients and 44 sex-, age-, and vaccine-matched convalescents 
using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To validate the mRNA-based 
findings, we measured plasma cytokine levels via Luminex 
technology. Our analysis revealed only minor differences in 
immune cell composition between the cohorts. In contrast, we 
identified numerous differently expressed genes (DEGs) that 
allowed for a clear clustering of patients and controls. 
These transcriptomic changes were predominantly observed in 
classical monocytes and were characterized by the 
downregulation of inflammation-associated genes, including 
IL1B, CCL3, -4, and -20 as well as CXCL1, -2, -3, and -8. 
Further analysis of transcription factor activity hinted at 
reduced inflammasome activity via SNAI1 and impaired 
differentiation of classical monocytes due to reduced ATF2. 
RNA velocity corroborated the findings of pre-mature 
classical monocytes in post-COVID patients. Based on these 
results, we hypothesize that patients either developed a 
state of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune tolerance that contributed 
to subsequent symptoms, or they possessed a predisposition 
of impaired innate immunity prior to infection, that 
facilitated the development of post-COVID.
